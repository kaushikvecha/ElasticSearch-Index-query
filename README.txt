## first run elasticsearch node on your  machine by 


 ./elasticsearch-1.3.4/bin/elasticsearch


## open a new terminal and run


python indexing.py


## after that query the data here I am doing a simple get query using python


python query.py 


## instead of query.py you have to use js to query and gather data
